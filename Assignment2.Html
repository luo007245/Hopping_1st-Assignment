<h1>1. Cricket</h1>

</div>
<h1>2. Football</h1>
<div><h4>1. Player</h4>
<p>Goalkeeper is the most defensive position in football. The goalkeeper's main job is to stop the other team from scoring by catching, palming or punching the ball from shots, headers and crosses. Unlike their teammates, goalkeepers typically remain in and around their own penalty area for most of the game. As a result, goalkeepers have a better view of the pitch and often give advice to their defence when the other team is on the attack or during set pieces.[4] Goalkeepers are the only players on the pitch who are allowed to handle the ball, but this is restricted to their own penalty area. Positioning is another important job and is one of the hardest to master as keeper.</p>

<div>
    <h4>2. Player</h4>
    <p>Defenders play behind the midfielders and their primary responsibility is to provide support to the team and to prevent the opposition from scoring a goal.[6] They usually remain in the half of the field that contains the goal they are defending. Taller defenders will move forward to the opposing team's penalty box when their team takes corner kicks or free kicks, where scoring with one's head is a possibility.</p>

<h1>3. Kabbadi</h1>
<div>
    <h4>1. Player</h4>
    <p>Covers- The defenders positioned inside the corners are referred to as the covers. They are placed between the ins and the corners. Generally, the teams position their all-rounders in this position. </p>
</div>

<div><h4>2. Player</h4>
<p>Corners- The corners of the team are deployed on the extreme right and left positions on the mat. The responsibility of the defender is to initiate tackles. When the left raider is in action, the right corner is in prime position to initiate any attack and vice versa. </p>
</div>
<h1>4. Hockey</h1>
<div>
    <h4>1. Player</h4>
    <p> Goalies

        Unlike field players, goalies are allowed to use any part of their body like their hands and feet as well as their hockey stick to stop the ball. Goalies only have one job and that is to protect the goal. Even so, their job is the most important and they have to stop the ball at all costs.
        </p>
</div>
<div><h4>2. Player</h4>
<p>Forwards are also known as the offensive line of the team, much like the strikers in football. They are the ones with the responsibility of taking accurate shots and score goals for the team. 

    More often than not, forwards are the fastest sprinters on the team. Those who play as forwards would usually have outstanding stick skills and lightning quick reflexes. They  have to be able to deflect shots quickly and create opportunities inside the shooting circle in order to score. </p>
</div>

   
<h1>5. Tenis</h1>
